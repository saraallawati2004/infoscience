#This is my journal

1. What did we do?
We watched a short videos, sort of as an intro to Computer Science, and learned different elements of programing. Then we did an excercise involving algorithms and creating an algorithm for making a Jelly sandwich. 

2. What did you learn?
Something specific that I learned in that first lesson was what ALgorithm meant - a set of insructions. Doing that excercise with the algorithm for Jell ysandwiches helped me understand that you have to be very specific with the algorithm given to a computer. I had to revise and change the insructions many times until ours worked in the end. This has also helped me with other classes - such as Scientific Lab Procedures. 

3. Questions that you have.
Not that I can think of right now other than what languages we're going to learn. I did my HW in Java but are we gonna use another language. 

HW = InitialHW#1 file. Rearranged circles to make the letter "S", it started off as calculations then turned into trial and error with the x and y values.

1. What did we do?
Learning some functions in Python. Specifically how to put text on circles, how to randomize location, color and size of circles... etc.

2. What did you learn?
I enjoyed learning about the random function and how to use it along with the delay function to slow the program down enough to see what's wrong with the algorithm. Overall, I learned a lot about Python (I only did Javascript previously).

3. Questions that you have.
While this isn't a major question, we're currentyly using a program to create a program. If I were to use HTML and CSS with Python, first, is that possible? And second, how would I link them?

1. What did I do?
Since I last updates this journal, I colaborated with Brianna to produce an optical illusion (posted on GitHub), followed some tutorials online showing some arrays and how to add shadows to objects, and I also used lists to update the corona virus simulation. Overall, I completed assignments which focused mainly on lists and how to use them (they're confusing to me, but I'm learning).


2. What did I learn?
Firstly, I learned what lists are on Python - it took me a while to understand what a list is and what it does to the code. And although I've been having lots of trouble, I continue to try. Especially when there's no one around me who I could ask questions to, immediately after I get stuck, the process has been hard. But at least I'm trying my best.

3. Questions that you have.
To be honest, I'm very confused on how to add things to the list from the setup function. I've been researching it and trying to figure it out, but I'm still lost. However, I will ask friends to see if they understand the concept and if they can help me understand it.
