1. What did we do?
We watched a short videos, sort of as an intro to Computer Science, and learned different elements of programing. Then we did an excercise involving algorithms and creating an algorithm for making a Jelly sandwich. 

2. What did you learn?
Something specific that I learned in that first lesson was what ALgorithm meant - a set of insructions. Doing that excercise with the algorithm for Jell ysandwiches helped me understand that you have to be very specific with the algorithm given to a computer. I had to revise and change the insructions many times until ours worked in the end. This has also helped me with other classes - such as Scientific Lab Procedures. 

3. Questions that you have.
Not that I can think of right now other than what languages we're going to learn. I did my HW in Java but are we gonna use another language.
