1. What did we do?
We watched a short videos, sort of as an intro to Computer Science, and learned different elements of programing. Then we did an excercise involving algorithms and creating an algorithm for making a Jelly sandwich. 

2. What did you learn?
Something specific that I learned in that first lesson was what ALgorithm meant - a set of insructions. Doing that excercise with the algorithm for Jell ysandwiches helped me understand that you have to be very specific with the algorithm given to a computer. I had to revise and change the insructions many times until ours worked in the end. This has also helped me with other classes - such as Scientific Lab Procedures. 

3. Questions that you have.
Not that I can think of right now other than what languages we're going to learn. I did my HW in Java but are we gonna use another language. 

HW = InitialHW#1 file. Rearranged circles to make the letter "S", it started off as calculations then turned into trial and error with the x and y values.

1. What did we do?
Learning some functions in Python. Specifically how to put text on circles, how to randomize location, color and size of circles... etc.

2. What did you learn?
I enjoyed learning about the random function and how to use it along with the delay function to slow the program down enough to see what's wrong with the algorithm. Overall, I learned a lot about Python (I only did Javascript previously).

3. Questions that you have.
While this isn't a major question, we're currentyly using a program to create a program. If I were to use HTML and CSS with Python, first, is that possible? And second, how would I link them?
